A fork of [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate) with multiple renderer windows (three in this demo), each with its own renderer process. Each window is functional in development and in the packaged app.

<br>

I am following the example of [this repo](https://github.com/jp887/electron-react-boilerplate) which does the same thing but starts from an earlier version of electron-react-boilerplate.
In the intervening time, electron-react-boilerplate has incorporated several changes including update from webpack 3 to webpack 5. These changes necessitate a few additional steps to be involved, most notably involving the HtmlWebpackPlugin plugin in webpack.config.renderer.dev.ts and webpack.config.renderer.prod.ts files. See [commit history](https://github.com/wds4/electron-react-boilerplate-multiple-windows/commits) for the steps.
